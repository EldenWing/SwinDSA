## Introduction

We use the mmsegmentation as the framework

## Installation

Please refer to [get_started.md](docs/get_started.md#installation) for installation and [dataset_prepare.md](docs/dataset_prepare.md#prepare-datasets) for dataset preparation.

## Get Started

Please see [train.md](docs/train.md) and [inference.md](docs/inference.md) for the basic usage of MMSegmentation.
There are also tutorials for [customizing dataset](docs/tutorials/customize_datasets.md), [designing data pipeline](docs/tutorials/data_pipeline.md), [customizing modules](docs/tutorials/customize_models.md), and [customizing runtime](docs/tutorials/customize_runtime.md).
We also provide many [training tricks](docs/tutorials/training_tricks.md) for better training and [useful tools](docs/useful_tools.md) for deployment.

A Colab tutorial is also provided. You may preview the notebook [here](demo/MMSegmentation_Tutorial.ipynb) or directly [run](https://colab.research.google.com/github/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/master/demo/MMSegmentation_Tutorial.ipynb) on Colab.


## Acknowledgement

MMSegmentation is an open source project that welcome any contribution and feedback.
We wish that the toolbox and benchmark could serve the growing research
community by providing a flexible as well as standardized toolkit to reimplement existing methods
and develop their own new semantic segmentation methods.
